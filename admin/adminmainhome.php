                          <h4 style="text-align:justify;"><b>About</b><br>At the Beauty Parlour, we believe in beauty with a conscience. We have created a salon that offers the highest quality hair services in a setting that is healthier for the environment, our guests and our staff. The Beauty Parlour is designed and built primarily with recycled materials: the floor is made of reclaimed wood from a local grain elevator – preserving and showcasing its natural texture – and most of the fixtures and furniture are refurbished or original vintage pieces.<br><br><b>Organizational Structure</b><br>
We carry high quality professional hair products designed to ensure our guests look their best, both in the salon and at home. The hair care products we carry have been carefully chosen based both on performance and eco-sensitivity. As a clean air salon, we offer ammonia-free colour services with little to no scent properties or chemical emanation. This healthier alternative to traditional colouring practices is also safe for expectant mothers and individuals with allergies or scent sensitivities. <br><br><b>Services</b><br>We offer a full range of salon treatments and styling services provided by a team of professional stylists, all in a clean air environment.<br>From cost-effective, recyclable packaging to naturally harvested ingredients, we are proud to provide our guests with the most health-conscious choices in professional hair care products.<br><br>
<b>Aim</b><br>
Our main focus is on quality and hygiene. Our Parlour is well equipped with advanced technology equipments and provides best quality services. Our staff is well trained and experienced, offering advanced services in Skin, Hair and Body Shaping that will provide you with a luxurious experience that leave you feeling relaxed and stress free.
